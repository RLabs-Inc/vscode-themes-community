# ${themeName} Theme for Visual Studio Code

This theme was generated using the [VSCode themes community](https://vscode-themes-community.vercel.app) theme generation tool, a unique tool, made by RLabs Inc., that creates harmonious color schemes based on the principles of sacred geometry patterns and color theory.

## Features

- Carefully crafted color palette derived from sacred geometry patterns
- Optimized for readability and reduced eye strain
- Supports a wide range of programming languages and file types

## Sacred Geometry in Color Design

The colors in this theme are not randomly chosen but are the result of a sophisticated algorithm that applies the principles of sacred geometry to color selection. This approach ensures a harmonious and aesthetically pleasing visual experience while coding.

Some key aspects of our color generation process include:

- Golden Ratio (Phi) based color relationships
- Fibonacci sequence influenced hue selections
- Sacred geometric shapes (like the Flower of Life) inspiring color harmony
