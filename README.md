## Sacred Geometry in Color Generation

Unlike traditional color theory schemes, VSCode Theme Generator employs sacred geometry patterns for color generation. This approach offers several unique benefits:

- **Harmonic Ratios**: Colors are selected based on proportions found in nature and sacred architecture, resulting in visually pleasing and balanced themes.
- **Unique Combinations**: The use of geometric patterns allows for unexpected yet harmonious color pairings.
- **Customizable Complexity**: Users can choose from various sacred geometry patterns, each offering different levels of color complexity.

Some of the patterns are:

- Fibonacci Spiral
- Golden Ratio
- Flower of Life
- Seed of Life
- Vesica Piscis
- Metatron's Cube
- Mandelbrot Set
- Pentagram
- Golden Spiral
- Golden Trisection
- Continued Fraction
- Farey Sequence
- Noble Numbers
- Metallic Means
- And many more...

These patterns inform the selection and relationship between colors in the generated themes, providing a fresh perspective on color harmony in design.
